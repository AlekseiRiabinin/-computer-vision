# Age Detection with Deep Learning CNN

## 1. Description
Many applications from biometrics, security control to entertainment use the information extracted from face images that contain information about age, gender, ethnic background, and emotional state. Automatic age estimation from facial images is one of the popular and challenging tasks that have different fields of applications such as controlling the content of the watched media depending on the customer's age. Automatic estimation of the age is a challenging process since the aging process among humans is non-uniform. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) showed significant success in face recognition, image classification, and object recognition. It consists of different convolutional layers where each layer processes the output of the previous layer in order to produce a robust and compact output.
