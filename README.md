# Age Detection with Deep Learning CNN

## 1. Description
Many applications from biometrics, security control to entertainment use the information extracted from face images that contain information about age, gender, ethnic background, and emotional state. Automatic age estimation from facial images is one of the popular and challenging tasks that have different fields of applications such as controlling the content of the watched media depending on the customer's age. Automatic estimation of the age is a challenging process since the aging process among humans is non-uniform. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) showed significant success in face recognition, image classification, and object recognition. It consists of different convolutional layers where each layer processes the output of the previous layer in order to produce a robust and compact output.

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 4. Results
Detection of age is of quite good precision with the ResNet50 pretrained model built in Keras. After approximately 10-15 minutes of learning on GPU the mean absolute error is around 7. By contrast, PyTorch models are not as accurate as previous ones because of limitations of CPU computation. Nonetheless, the error goes down gradually, so that the architecture of the neural network is designed properly.
